## Getting Help

Getting help with questions or problems that you have with the Python can be quite easy, you just have to know where to look. The following areas are great places to start looking for help and asking questions. 

### Google

Not gonna lie, my first response to error messages is to search for the issue on Google. For example, if you get an error message, use the message as your search term. Or if you want to know more about a specific function, use the name of the function as your search term. This usually leads me to StackExchange/Stack Overflow or to official Python documentation (see below).


### StackExchange and Stack Overflow

Both StackExchange and Stack Overflow are great Q&A websites to go to for help. Without signing up for an account, you can look through the questions and answers already posted. With an account, you can post your own questions for other to answer.

1. [Python Documentation](https://stackoverflow.com/documentation/python/topics)
2. [Questions with Python Tags](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python)
3. [StackExchange's Python Code Review](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/python)


### Python.org website and Code Documentation

The main [Python](https://www.python.org) website contains everything you ever wanted to know about Python, including:

1. [Beginner's Guide about Downloading and Installing Python](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download)
2. [Beginner's Guide for Non-Programmers](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/NonProgrammers)
3. [Code Examples for Beginners](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Examples)
4. [Complete Python Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/)
5. [Frequently Asked Questions](https://docs.python.org/3/faq/)
6. [Python Mailing Lists](https://www.python.org/community/lists/), including the [Python-Help](https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/python-help) mailing list where you can post all sorts of questions about Python and volunteer experts will reply.
7. [The Python Wiki](https://wiki.python.org/moin/)

When having trouble with a specific library, there is usually documentation about that library that will help you debug. Some common libraries and their documentation links include

1. [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/)
2. [NLTK Documentation](https://github.com/nltk/nltk/wiki)
3. [Tweepy](http://tweepy.readthedocs.io/en/v3.6.0/)
