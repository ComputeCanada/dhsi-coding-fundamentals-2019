## Class Description

This course is intended for humanities-based researchers who do not have a programming background, but would like to understand how programs work "behind the scenes." Over the week, the emphasis will be on understanding how computer programmers think so that participants will be able to participate in high-level conceptual discussions with more confidence. These general concepts will be reinforced and illustrated with hands-on development of simple programs that can be used to assist with text-based research and analysis. Participants will work on larger projects of their own choosing for about a day and a half at the end of the course.

The programming language used for most of the course will be Python. Python has an easy-to-learn and gentle syntax, and powerful extensions. Use of the command-line interface will also be demonstrated.

## Learning Outcomes

You should walk away from this course with the following knowledge:
  - Using the command line to manage files and folders, and run scripts.
  - Installing and accessing Python via multiple platforms.
  - Learn to write psuedocode to map out your program.
  - Understanding of the Python 3.x programming language, including the ability to write simple scripts.
