## Class Description

This course is intended for humanities-based researchers who do not have a programming background, but would like to understand how programs work "behind the scenes." Over the week, the emphasis will be on understanding how computer programmers think so that participants will be able to participate in high-level conceptual discussions with more confidence. These general concepts will be reinforced and illustrated with hands-on development of simple programs that can be used to assist with text-based research and analysis. Participants will work on larger projects of their own choosing for about a day and a half at the end of the course.

The programming language used for most of the course will be Python. Python has an easy-to-learn and gentle syntax, and powerful extensions. Use of the command-line interface will also be demonstrated.

## Learning Outcomes

You should walk away from this course with the following knowledge:
  - Using the command line to manage files and folders, and run scripts.
  - Installing and accessing Python via multiple platforms.
  - Learn to write psuedocode to map out your program.
  - Understanding of the Python 3.x programming language, including the ability to write simple scripts.
  
  ## Reading Material
  
  ## Before Day 1: Software Installation

**Anaconda** - If possible, please install Anaconda before this course begins.  You can find the free download at -> https://www.continuum.io/downloads. Make sure to download version 5.1 (or greater) of Anaconda and choose the Python 3.6 (or greater) version.  If you have trouble with the install then we will help you complete the install on the first day of class.

**Text Editor** - Most operating systems come pre-installed with at least one version of a text editor. However, programmers tend to like to use more complex text editors that are designed to work with programming languages and provide helpful visual cues that alert users to potential errors in their code. There are a lot of options to use, as you can see from this [list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_text_editors ). A good option is [Sublime Text 3] (https://www.sublimetext.com/3 ), which runs uniformly across platforms and has a nice combination of a simple interface and powerful extensions, however you can use a different text editor if you have one you're already familiar with. Jessica, for example, prefers the Mac-only text editor [BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/).
