    "In 1582, (most of) Catholic Europe adopted a new calendar: the Gregorian calendar that we use today. However, other parts of Europe continued to use the Julian calendar for decades or even centuries, creating a difference of 10 or 11 days between these calendars. This is a program to convert dates from the Gregorian to Julian calendar, for dates between 1582 and 1752 (when Great Britain adopted the Gregorian calendar). The year 1700 was a leap year for the Julian calendar but not for the Gregorian calendar - for simplicity, we assume the difference between them changes on 1/1/1700 (it really changes on Gregorian date 3/10/1700)."
