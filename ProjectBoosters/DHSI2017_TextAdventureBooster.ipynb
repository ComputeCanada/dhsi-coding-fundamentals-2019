    "# Text Adventure Booster\n",
    "This is meant to get you started thinking about how to implement the basic structure of a text adventure in Python.  You need to be clear about _what_ you want player's to be able to do in the adventure. Start simple, we can always add complexity later.  So, it is better to get something working that allows a player to just move through the game first _and then_ take a copy of that and modify it to make it necessary for the player to collect and carry objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "It will be _really_ important for you to understand loops, conditionals, and either lists or dictionaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Michael and Jennifer built a Star Trek text adventure in the 2014 class.  The code that they used is fully functional and below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure you understand the code and what is going on in general by:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Adding comments to the code to explain it to your future self.\n",
    "2. Uncommenting the print statements to figure out what is being done when (feel free to add your own too).\n",
    "3. Coming up with _a different_ way to hold the information needed to hold the information needed to hold the data for your story."
